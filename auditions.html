    					<p>Auditions consist of learning one or two dance routines taught at the audition, along with basic stretches and terminology sessions. Selections will be made on the basis of performance, talent, appearance and ability to synchronize movements. For a successful audition, you normally should have had several years of dance training experience. 
						This group is not a pom-pom group but strictly a dance unit. Costumes (with the exception of footwear, trunks and leotards etc.) will be furnished by the Department of Bands (a complete list of items that you must supply will be available at the audition). 
						Please wear form-fitting dance attire and soft dance shoes or tennis shoes to the audition.
						If you are accepted as a RedStepper, you must attend the remainder of band camp.</p>
