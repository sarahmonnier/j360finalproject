    					<p>The Indiana University RedSteppers are celebrating 44 years of precision dancing excellence with The Marching Hundred, and look forward to continuing this outstanding tradition with the installment of its 2016 Squad.</p>
    					<p>The RedSteppers were first established as an auxiliary unit of the Marching Hundred in 1972. From the beginning the group was known for their red boots, high kicks, splits and performing in unison with the band at halftime.
    					Since then the RedSteppers have become increasingly more prominent throughout gamedays at Memorial Stadium. They perform before the game at The Walk during tailgates, during pregame, halftime, third quarter and throughout the game in the end zone doing stand tunes to whatever the band decides to play.</p>
    					<p>Along with performances on gamedays, the RedSteppers have rehearsal Monday through Friday from 4:10 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. in Gladstein Fieldhouse. Depending on the football schedule, they will learn new halftime shows or stand tunes each week, so picking up new choreography quickly is key. 
    					Other requirements of the team, are traveling to usually one away game each season, a Colts halftime performance, bowl games, performances for Freshman Orientation at "Spirits and Traditions" and Homecoming.</p>
